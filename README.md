# Google Calendar API (GCal)

This Google Calendar API module allows you to manage your
Google calendars. APIs provided by the module will allow you 
to create, update, delete, and fetch calendar details.
You can also create, update, delete, get, or move an
event from a particular calendar, and fetch calendar 
settings, color details, etc.

You need to write your own module to use the APIs of this 
module and thereby manage calendars and events.

This is a port from the Drupal module of the same name. It contains
two sub-modules: gauth_login and gauth_user.

## Requirements

This module depends on the Google Auth module, which depends
on the Google API PHP client library.


## Installation

- Install this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions at
  https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules.
  
- Also install the Google Auth module (GAuth) for Backdrop.
  

## Help & Documentation

the work done by the developer and maintainer of the Drupal module.
